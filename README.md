# Media-Dashboard

Media-Dashboard is a web-based dashboard that visualizes trends in data from social media APIs.
Currently, the dashboard only works with the Youtube Data API but will soon function with the Twitter API.

Plans to add:
* Functionality with ML models to analyze trends in data.
* Custom search functions.
